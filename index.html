        <p>Outside of work and university, I am passionate about coding and technology innovation. I enjoy working on personal projects that involve developing software solutions to everyday problems. This hobby directly relates to my career goals as it keeps my skills sharp and allows me to experiment with new technologies and methodologies. My coursework in software development and IT management at the University of the Fraser Valley has provided a solid foundation that I am excited to build upon in my professional journey.</p>
    
        <h3>Key Experiences and Skills</h3>
        <p>Two pivotal experiences stand out in my career:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Laptop Deployment Project at Kwantlen Polytechnic University:</strong> I orchestrated a comprehensive laptop deployment during the COVID-19 pandemic, managing over 700 devices. This experience honed my project management and organizational skills, as well as my ability to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances.</li>
            <li><strong>Transition to Windows 11 at the University of the Fraser Valley:</strong> As a Support Analyst, I played a key role in ensuring a smooth transition for end-users. This involved resolving over 450 hardware, software, and network issues, showcasing my technical troubleshooting abilities and customer service skills.</li>
        </ul>
